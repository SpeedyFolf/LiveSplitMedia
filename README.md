# LiveSplitMedia

## About
Settings, language translations, layouts, splits, and split icons.

## Notes
If something doesn't work or look right, you are probably using a different version of LiveSplit, missing components, or missing fonts.

Me and Joshimuz use a custom version of LiveSplit which lets you break it into more columns/rows.\

VLC media player 3.0.x works with this version of LiveSplit, so you could technically use the Video component to show your PB video, but that makes LiveSplit freeze/hang for me and I heard it doesn't work for Joshimuz for some reason, so he puts his PB video directly in OBS.

## Fonts
Joshimuz (Josh) tends to use [Exo](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Exo)\
LotsOfS (S.) tends to use [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Barlow)
